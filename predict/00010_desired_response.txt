A woman is standing on a beach, playing a musical instrument. She is facing the ocean, which is behind her. The sky is blue and clear, and the moon is visible in the upper left corner of the image.

In the foreground of the image, there is a lion lying on the beach. The lion is facing the woman, and its tail is curled around its body. To the right of the lion, there is a mountain range.

The woman is wearing a long dress, and she has her hair tied back in a ponytail. She is holding a stick in her right hand and an instrument in her left hand.

The beach is sandy and has a few palm trees scattered around. The water in the ocean is blue and calm.
