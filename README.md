# Art Unveiled: Enhancing Access to Arts for the Visually Impaired
Our goal is to train a object detection model using various paintings and at the end, we will have audio descriptions from the paintings's tags.

It is essential to run this project using google colab.
You need to create a new folder in your google drive named **_all_data_final_** in which you need to put all the necessary subfolders from the project, in order to execute the .ipynb file.
